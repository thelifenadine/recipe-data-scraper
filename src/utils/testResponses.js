With its wonderfully open crumb, it's great alongside soup, stew, or pasta; and also makes a delicious sandwich. Bonus: This loaf uses no commercially produced yeast, for those of you who enjoy baking with starter alone.","recipeYield":"2 loaves","prepTime":"PT15M","datePublished":"February 6, 2017 at 7:00pm","totalTime":"PT17H25M","cookTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["1 1/4 cups (149g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour","1/3 cup (74g) room-temperature (70°F) water","1/8 cup (28g) ripe (fed) sourdough starter","2 cups + 2 tablespoons (482g) water 75°F to 80°F","5 1/4 cups (631g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour","1/2 cup (50g) King Arthur Organic Pumpernickel Flour or rye flour","1 tablespoon salt"],"recipeInstructions":"To make the levain: Knead together the levain ingredients to make a smooth, stiff dough. Place the levain in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it, and allow it to ferment overnight at room temperature (65°F to 75°F). It should take the levain about 12 hours to mature. The mature levain will have doubled in size and be domed on top, or just beginning to sink in the middle., To make the dough: Tear the levain into small pieces and add it to the dough water. Add the remaining ingredients and mix until there are no remaining dry pockets of flour. If mixing by hand, use a dough scraper to blend the dough and break down the levain. In a stand mixer, mix the dough on the lowest speed for 2 minutes using the hook attachment., Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes., Knead the dough by hand for 3 minutes, or in a stand mixer for 1 1/2 minutes on speed 2. The dough will be quite sticky., Allow the dough to rise for 60 minutes in an oiled and covered bowl., Give the dough a fold and return it to the bowl to rise for another 60 minutes., Gently deflate the dough and divide it in half. Pre-shape it into two rounds. Place the rounds seam side up on a floured surface, covered well. Let the rounds relax for 20 minutes., Shape the loaves into either a bâtard (football) shape or a round (depending on how you plan to bake it)., Cover the loaves with greased plastic wrap and allow them to rise on lightly greased parchment for approximately 2 hours. Loaves can also rise in an oiled Dutch oven or cloche; or seam side up in a well-floured brotform, or a bowl lined with a very well-floured cloth., Alternatively, refrigerate the loaves after shaping for up to 16 hours before baking., Preheat the oven to 450°F. If you’re planning to bake on a stone with steam, preheat the stone and a cast iron frying pan on the shelf below the stone for 60 minutes., Score the loaves with one long angled cut down the center of the loaf, and spray or brush them with water., When baking on a stone, slide the parchment and loaf onto the hot stone. Pour 1 1/2 cups boiling water into the cast iron frying pan. Be sure to wear good oven mitts to prevent a steam burn., If baking in a Dutch oven or cloche, remove the lid after 20 minutes and allow the loaf to finish baking in a dry oven., Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes. The loaves should be a rich brown, firm on the sides, and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Their internal temperature should be 195°F., Remove the loaves from the oven, and cool them on a rack. Store at room temperature, lightly wrapped, for a day or so; freeze for longer storage.","author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"King Arthur Flour","url":"https://www.kingarthurflour.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.kingarthurflour.com/themes/custom/kaf_nextgenweb/images/logo--full.svg"}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.kingarthurflour.com/sites/default/files/recipe_legacy/9021-3-large.jpg"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.30","ratingCount":"42"}}]}],

Nice and lemony, not too sweet with good proportions of curd and meringue. My second attempt on lemon meringue pie.\r\nI recommend stirring the curd very frequently to prevent burning. Remove the curd from heat only after it becomes really, really thick. Meringue to be added onto hot curd, such that the meringue bottom will cook. If the meringue bottom is not cooked the meringue will liquify and the pie will fail. Also let the pie sit for an hour at room temperature after baking, then 3 hours in the fridge to ensure everything has solidified, else upon cutting it the curd will ooze.

In perfecting my technique, I'd like to suggest mix in one bowl the water, lemon zest, and lemon juice; mix in another bowl the sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt. 12/02: This is a successful recipe for a delicious pie.  I tried another recipe twice before for this kind of pie but the results were less than desirable.  This recipe came out just right.  The filling was firm, not runny!  I zested 1 lemon rather than 2, but used the juice of 2. I'd like to offer the following: The recipe doesn't tell you about cooling and refrigeration.  I let my pie cool 1 hr on a cookie rack, 3-6 hrs uncovered in the refrig before slicing, after 6 hrs in refrig, cover the pie (I used foil rather than plastic wrap.)

I made this tonight for my dad and it came out great.   The only thing that I wasn't clear on was the amount of lemon juice to use. 2 lemons can mean different things to different people.  I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice(about 3 lemons) and 1 tablespoon of zest.  It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  Also, it doesn't mention how to cool it.  I left it at room temperature for about an hour and then put it in the refrigerator for about 5 hours.  One tip I have is after the lemon filling starts to boil, only boil it for 1 minute so the cornstarch doesn't lose its thickening power.  Then, after you add the tempered eggs back into the hot mixture, boil one more minute and it will be a perfect thickness.  Also, when you fill the pie crust with the lemon filling, the crust should still be warm and when you top the pie with the meringue, the filling should still be pretty warm.  This will help seal the meringue after it cools so it doesn't separate from the crust.  I will definitely keep this recipe and I have a feeling I will be making this again very soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"mamazilla","image":null,"sameAs":"https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1488733"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2007-01-22T01:47:49.7Z","reviewBody":"this pie was fantastic...after two tries of making it.  the first try, it didn't make nearly enough to fill the pie plate (a deep dish 9\" plate).  also, it made kind of a gelatinous, almost clear jelly type substance.  the flavor was good, but not at all what i was expecting.  so, i dumped it and tried again the next day.  after reading ALL the reviews, i followed Angela's suggestions from page 10.  I changed the servings to 12, used milk instead of water (huge difference), used the zest from 3 lemons and the juice i got from them, which was 1/2 c., which was perfect, i also used about 1/2 tablespoon more cornstarch.  making those changes yielded a yellow custard that i am used to seeing in lemon pies.  after whisking the egg mixture back in, i lowered the heat to medium low and stirred until i felt it was thick enough.  (maybe 10-15 minutes of constant stirring).  after i spooned it into the pie shell and topped with meringue i let it cool to room temperature for over an hour then put it in the fridge for about 4 hours before i served it.  i used Pie Crust IV and Meringue II from this site.  it was, as my, self-proclaimed-lemon-meringue-pie- connoisseur father said:  \"pretty damn impressive\".

The ones I've tried were either sour or gummy or both. A friend requested a lemon pie so I gave it a shot. This recipe turned out perfectly, even I was surprised how much I love the taste. Took the suggestions to use 1/4 c. lemon juice, and milk (2%) instead of water. The filling was beautifully creamy, not too sweet, not too tart. I piled the meringue high on a hot filling. Make sure to nudge the meringue all the way to the edge of the crust to seal the filling. Was very happy with the results. No shrinking meringue, no watery layer, no seepage of the filling after the pie was cut. Even after refrigeration there were just a few little beads of sugary moisture dotting the meringue, but the filling held up and didn't sog up the bottom crust. I used Martha Stewart's Pate Brisee recipe (all butter).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"MZMUFFIN","image":null,"sameAs":"https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/857029"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2012-03-17T15:19:11.203Z","reviewBody":"Everyone who is having problems with water in your pie **you cannot cover a lemon meringue pie with plastic wrap to store it, condensation forms and will leave you with a puddle in your pie** to store very loosely cover it with tented aluminum foil leaving a little opening for moisture to escape","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"LOVECED","image":null,"sameAs":"https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1280465"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2010-10-26T21:40:13.18Z","reviewBody":"If you are even thinking about making this pie, READ THIS REVIEW!!  This pie is fantastic!  Wonderful lemon flavor, as it's just the right balance of sweet and tart.  However, I did make a few minor adjustments.  First of all, while I'm sure experienced bakers picked up on this, this recipe does not specify that the crust must be pre-baked before adding the filling, otherwise you will end up with either a raw crust or a burnt meringue.  I pre-baked mine for 9 minutes.  2)DO NOT try to sub bottled lemon juice for the real thing.  It definitely changes the taste.  I used the juice of 3 lemons, which came to 1/2 cup, and the zest of 1.  3)I used milk instead of water and it gave the filling a delicious creamy texture.  4)I always double the recipe to get a nice, thick layer of lemon custard, if you make the recipe as shown, your custard layer will be only about half an inch thick.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"703wifenmom","image":null,"sameAs":"https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/5594781"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2012-08-07T11:07:50.81Z","reviewBody":"This is a good, but fairly standard lemon meringue pie with a rich, tart filling, and fluffy meringue.

I would have preferred a thicker pie, however, so were I to make this again I would increase the recipe overall by half.

You’ll be floored by how much flavor fits into one bowl of this meatless meal. This simple recipe will be on your table in just 50 minutes, and every bite has sweet, spicy, salty, and savory notes. If you’re new to cooking with plantains, we have a tip from the Test Kitchen: Plantains are ready to cook when their peels turn black on the outside, so buy them black or let them ripen before cooking. Many grocery stores sell heat-and-serve frozen plantains too. You’ll love the sweet crunch the plantains give this colorful dish, so gather the family around the table and tell them to dig in.","prepTime":null,"cookTime":null,"totalTime":"PT50M","recipeYield":"Serves 4","recipeIngredient":["2  ripe plantains, peeled and diagonally sliced 1⁄2 inch thick (about 1 lb.)","2 tablespoons olive oil, divided","1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided","1  (10-oz.) pkg. yellow rice","1  small jalapeño chile, seeded and finely chopped (about 1 Tbsp.)","1 1/4 cups chopped red onion (from 1 onion), divided","2  (16-oz.) cans seasoned black beans, drained (do not rinse)","1/4 cup water","1 teaspoon ground cumin","4  radishes (about 3 oz.), chopped","1  ripe avocado, diced","1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro","1  lime, quartered"],"recipeInstructions":"Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place plantain slices in a single layer on parchment; drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil, and sprinkle with 1⁄2 teaspoon of the salt. Roast in preheated oven until lightly browned and very tender, 16 to 18 minutes. Set aside. Prepare rice according to package directions. While rice and plantains cook, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan over medium. Add jalapeño and 1 cup of the red onion; cook, stirring often, until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in black beans, water, cumin, and remaining 1⁄2 teaspoon salt; cook until liquid is slightly reduced, 5 to 6 minutes. Divide cooked rice evenly among 4 bowls. Top each with beans, roasted plantains, chopped radishes, and diced avocado. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and remaining 1⁄4 cup red onion. Serve with lime wedges.","recipeCategory":[],"recipeCuisine":[],"author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"MyRecipes"},"aggregateRating":null,"nutrition":null,"review":[]}]]

So I came up with this simple method that takes just 25 minutes of active prep time. The healthy food components can be enjoyed for several days in power bowls, wraps, and even stirred into soups! Power bowls are so fun for family meals because you can switch up the veggies and toppings to suit each palate, giving kids control to build their own bowls. This recipe is also a handy make-ahead option if you’re having friends over for a meal. Simply chop all the veggies the night before and refrigerate them in containers. Just before your guests arrive, pop the veggies into the oven, cook the quinoa, and prep the toppings. After cooking, you can all have fun assembling your own power bowls and everyone will be super impressed by the stunning rainbow-coloured meal!","prepTime":"PT25M","cookTime":"PT35M","totalTime":"PT1H","keywords":"Vegan, Gluten-Free, Nut-Free, Refined Sugar-Free, Soy-Free, Budget Friendly, Homemade Staples, Kid Friendly, Make-Ahead, Party Favourite, Quick &amp; Easy","recipeYield":"8 servings","recipeCategory":["Vegan","Grain"," Other Main"," Salad"],"recipeCuisine":["Canadian"],"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1 of 8 bowls","calories":"450 calorie","fatContent":"14 grams","saturatedFatContent":"2 grams","sodiumContent":"320 milligrams","carbohydrateContent":"73 grams","fiberContent":"9 grams","sugarContent":"17 grams","proteinContent":"15 grams"},"suitableForDiet":["https://schema.org/GlutenFreeDiet","https://schema.org/VeganDiet","https://schema.org/VegetarianDiet"],"recipeIngredient":["3 small (680 g) sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped (4 cups)","4 cups (500 g) brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved*","1 medium (800 g) cauliflower, chopped into small florets (4 heaping cups)","1 medium (230 g) red onion, peeled and chopped","2 large (500 g) red bell peppers, seeded and chopped","3 tablespoons (45 mL) extra-virgin olive oil, divided","Salt and pepper, to taste","2 cups (400 g) uncooked quinoa**","1 medium (370 g) English cucumber, chopped","1 medium (135 g) bunch green onions, chopped","2 cups (255 g) grape tomatoes (1 dry pint)","Chopped lettuce/greens (Romaine, Iceberg, kale, etc)","Salad dressing***","Ripe avocados","Cooked beans or lentils","Nuts and seeds (I use hemp hearts and roasted pepitas)","Hummus or pesto"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Position two oven racks near the middle of the oven.
